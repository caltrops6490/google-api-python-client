<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="bind">bind(id, part, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None, onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel=None, streamId=None)</code>
  <pre>Binds a YouTube broadcast to a stream or removes an existing binding between a broadcast and a stream. A broadcast can only be bound to one video stream, though a video stream may be bound to more than one broadcast.

Args:
  id: string, The id parameter specifies the unique ID of the broadcast that is being bound to a video stream. (required)
  part: string, The part parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more liveBroadcast resource properties that the API response will include. The part names that you can include in the parameter value are id, snippet, contentDetails, and status. (required)
  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request&#x27;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
  onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel: string, This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter specifies the YouTube channel ID of the channel to which a video is being added. This parameter is required when a request specifies a value for the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and it can only be used in conjunction with that parameter. In addition, the request must be authorized using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. Finally, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.

This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.
  streamId: string, The streamId parameter specifies the unique ID of the video stream that is being bound to a broadcast. If this parameter is omitted, the API will remove any existing binding between the broadcast and a video stream.

    <code class="details" id="control">control(id, part, displaySlate=None, offsetTimeMs=None, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None, onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel=None, walltime=None)</code>
  <pre>Controls the settings for a slate that can be displayed in the broadcast stream.

Args:
  id: string, The id parameter specifies the YouTube live broadcast ID that uniquely identifies the broadcast in which the slate is being updated. (required)
  part: string, The part parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more liveBroadcast resource properties that the API response will include. The part names that you can include in the parameter value are id, snippet, contentDetails, and status. (required)
  displaySlate: boolean, The displaySlate parameter specifies whether the slate is being enabled or disabled.
  offsetTimeMs: string, The offsetTimeMs parameter specifies a positive time offset when the specified slate change will occur. The value is measured in milliseconds from the beginning of the broadcast&#x27;s monitor stream, which is the time that the testing phase for the broadcast began. Even though it is specified in milliseconds, the value is actually an approximation, and YouTube completes the requested action as closely as possible to that time.

If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then YouTube performs the action as soon as possible. See the Getting started guide for more details.

Important: You should only specify a value for this parameter if your broadcast stream is delayed.
  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request&#x27;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
  onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel: string, This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter specifies the YouTube channel ID of the channel to which a video is being added. This parameter is required when a request specifies a value for the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and it can only be used in conjunction with that parameter. In addition, the request must be authorized using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. Finally, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.

This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.
  walltime: string, The walltime parameter specifies the wall clock time at which the specified slate change will occur. The value is specified in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ) format.

    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(id, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None, onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a broadcast.

Args:
  id: string, The id parameter specifies the YouTube live broadcast ID for the resource that is being deleted. (required)
  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request&#x27;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
  onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel: string, This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter specifies the YouTube channel ID of the channel to which a video is being added. This parameter is required when a request specifies a value for the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and it can only be used in conjunction with that parameter. In addition, the request must be authorized using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. Finally, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.

This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.

  broadcastStatus: string, The broadcastStatus parameter filters the API response to only include broadcasts with the specified status.
    Allowed values
      active - Return current live broadcasts.
      all - Return all broadcasts.
      completed - Return broadcasts that have already ended.
      upcoming - Return broadcasts that have not yet started.
  broadcastType: string, The broadcastType parameter filters the API response to only include broadcasts with the specified type. This is only compatible with the mine filter for now.
    Allowed values
      all - Return all broadcasts.
      event - Return only scheduled event broadcasts.
      persistent - Return only persistent broadcasts.
  id: string, The id parameter specifies a comma-separated list of YouTube broadcast IDs that identify the broadcasts being retrieved. In a liveBroadcast resource, the id property specifies the broadcast&#x27;s ID.
  maxResults: integer, The maxResults parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set.
  mine: boolean, The mine parameter can be used to instruct the API to only return broadcasts owned by the authenticated user. Set the parameter value to true to only retrieve your own broadcasts.
  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request&#x27;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
  onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel: string, This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter specifies the YouTube channel ID of the channel to which a video is being added. This parameter is required when a request specifies a value for the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and it can only be used in conjunction with that parameter. In addition, the request must be authorized using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. Finally, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.

This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.
  pageToken: string, The pageToken parameter identifies a specific page in the result set that should be returned. In an API response, the nextPageToken and prevPageToken properties identify other pages that could be retrieved.

  <pre>Updates a broadcast. For example, you could modify the broadcast settings defined in the liveBroadcast resource&#x27;s contentDetails object.

Args:
  part: string, The part parameter serves two purposes in this operation. It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include.

The part properties that you can include in the parameter value are id, snippet, contentDetails, and status.

Note that this method will override the existing values for all of the mutable properties that are contained in any parts that the parameter value specifies. For example, a broadcast&#x27;s privacy status is defined in the status part. As such, if your request is updating a private or unlisted broadcast, and the request&#x27;s part parameter value includes the status part, the broadcast&#x27;s privacy setting will be updated to whatever value the request body specifies. If the request body does not specify a value, the existing privacy setting will be removed and the broadcast will revert to the default privacy setting. (required)

  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request&#x27;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
  onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel: string, This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter specifies the YouTube channel ID of the channel to which a video is being added. This parameter is required when a request specifies a value for the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter, and it can only be used in conjunction with that parameter. In addition, the request must be authorized using a CMS account that is linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies. Finally, the channel that the onBehalfOfContentOwnerChannel parameter value specifies must be linked to the content owner that the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter specifies.

This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and perform actions on behalf of the channel specified in the parameter value, without having to provide authentication credentials for each separate channel.
